# Datasheet for Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment Datasets

## Abstract 

Over the years, many subjective and objective quality assessment datasets have been created and made available to the research community. However, there is no standard process for documenting the various aspects of the dataset, such as details about the source sequences, number of test subjects, test methodology, encoding settings, etc. Such information is often of great importance to the end-user of the dataset as it can help them get a quick understanding of the motivation and scope of the dataset. Without such a template, it is left to each reader to collate the information from the relevant publication or website, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. In some cases, the absence of a template to guide the documentation process can result in an unintentional omission of some important information. 

We addresses this simple but significant gap by proposing a datasheet template for documenting various aspects of subjective and objective quality assessment datasets for multimedia data. The template presented in this work aim to simplify the documentation process for existing and new datasets and improve their reproducibility.

## Datasheet Template

The datasheet template can be accessed in any of the below formats (**use the google sheet version if you can**):

- [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DJAuefveWRWUdR8nQvkDGdfURq_m9yU5NragTPW2Y0w/edit?usp=sharing) (please use "File --> make a copy" to get a local copy with edit rights) A slightly updated version is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4_scXs51OBCCTVRLkEBkL0kel_RJVkigzCwKnAXmBw/edit?usp=sharing)
- [MS Excel](https://github.com/NabajeetBarman/datasheet-for-qoe-datasets/blob/main/Datasheet%20for%20QoE%20Datasets%20v1.0.xlsx)
- [OpenDocument Spreadsheet](https://github.com/NabajeetBarman/datasheet-for-qoe-datasets/blob/main/Datasheet%20for%20QoE%20Datasets%20v1.0.ods)

The above three formats allow the user to easily fill in the various fields. However, if neither of these formats work for you for any reason, please refer to the following two formats to reproduce the datasheet template in a desired format:
- [HTML](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/NabajeetBarman/datasheet-for-qoe-datasets/blob/main/Datasheet%20for%20QoE%20Datasets%20v1.0.html) 
- [PDF](https://github.com/NabajeetBarman/datasheet-for-qoe-datasets/blob/main/Datasheet%20for%20QoE%20Datasets%20v1.0.pdf)
